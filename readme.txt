StatusNet Widget provides a widget to pull your status from StatusNet
sites like identi.ca. Multiple sources are supported, so is Ohloh.

== Description ==

This widget aims to provide an easy integration of your StatusNet (identi.ca)
and Ohloh timelines into your WordPress.
It can also be used to display timelines for tags or groups.
You can provide multiple sources (= links to your profiles at identi.ca, Ohloh
or your own StatusNet installation), which will get fetched, merged (if you want
it to do so, like when you are posting the same content to multiple StatusNet
sites) and displayed in your sidebar (with #hashtag, !group and @people links).


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `statusnet-widget` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add the Widget in the 'Widgets' menu in Wordpress
   * 'Merge Mode' means duplicate statuses will be ignored
   * 'Prefer content with markup' means the markup delivered by StatusNet etc will be used instead of parsing the message for @users, #tags, !groups and links ourself.
   * 'Source List' should contain one source per line
     (where source is something like http://identi.ca/evgeni)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I fetch a #tag/!group from identi.ca (StatusNet)? =
Add http://identi.ca/tag/debian or http://identi.ca/group/debian as a source.

= How do I fetch a user/project from Ohloh? =
Add https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/EvgeniGolov or http://www.ohloh.net/p/debian as a source.

= What is 'Prefer content with markup'? =
When this is checked, arbitrary markup is parsed from the source. I personally do not like the idea of displaying markup from a remote/unknown/untrusted source in my site. In theory StatusNet and co could inject any markup (incl JavaScript!) into my site.

However, in certain setups, such as StatusNet's federation, this will fix username links when replying to people across instances (i.e. from a personal StatusNet site to indenti.ca).

Consider the risks, and decided if this works for you.
